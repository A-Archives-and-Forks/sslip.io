      <h1>k-v.io</h1>
      <p>A DNS-based Key-Value Store. <a href="https://ci.nono.io/teams/main/pipelines/sslip.io"><img alt="badge" src=
      "https://ci.nono.io/api/v1/teams/main/pipelines/sslip.io/badge"></a></p>
      <h2>Quick Start</h2>
      <p>In the following examples, <i>my-key</i> is the key, and <i>my-value</i> is the value.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>To set a key: <code>dig @ns.sslip.io put.my-value.my-key.k-v.io txt +short</code></li>
        <li>To get a key: <code>dig @ns.sslip.io my-key.k-v.io txt +short</code></li>
        <li>To delete a key: <code>dig @ns.sslip.io delete.my-key.k-v.io txt +short</code></li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Notes:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Values are stored as TXT records.</li>
        <li>Keys must be valid DNS subdomains, i.e. only alphanumerics and dashes, and cannot exceed 63 characters.
        "my-key" is valid, but "my#key" is not.</li>
        <li>Values can be one or more subdomains, i.e. alphanumerics, dashes, and <i>dots</i>, and are truncated to 63
        characters. For example, <code>dig put.3.14159.pi.k-v.io txt +short</code> sets the the key "pi" to the value
        "3.14159".</li>
        <li>If you need special characters ("!@#$%^ðŸ˜Š"), consider <a href=
        "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base32">Base32</a> encoding, but remember that the padding character ("=") is
        illegal.
        </li>
        <li>The three verbs are <code>put</code>, <code>get</code>, and <code>delete</code>, e.g. <code>dig
        delete.pi.k-v.io txt +short</code>.</li>
        <li>The verb <code>get</code> is the default verb: <code>dig pi.k-v.io txt +short</code> is identical to
        <code>dig get.pi.k-v.io txt +short</code>.</li>
        <li>There's no read security: when you set a key "my-super-secret-password" to the value "dont-tell-anyone",
        anyone can read it.</li>
        <li>There's no write security: you may set the key "best-rugby-team" to the value "all-blacks", and someone
        else could change it a minute later to "springboks".</li>
        <li>If you don't want someone to mess with your keys, you should probably use GUIDs or something fairly unique
        as a key, e.g. <code>dig put.my-value.df616686-26e8-4da8-8104-a24aa0196bc7.k-v.io txt +short</code></li>
        <li>I have no idea how well this system will scale.</li>
        <li>I'll probably expire keys that haven't been accessed in a month, but I haven't written that code yet.</li>
        <li>This project is very much in beta. Assume you may lose your keys at any time.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>DNS Caching/Propagation:</h3>
      <p>You don't need to specify our nameservers ("<code>@ns.sslip.io</code>") in your <code>dig</code> invocations
      if you don't mind dealing with the vagaries of DNS caching and propagation. Here are some of the problems you'll
      face:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>When you change or delete a key, it may take up to 3 minutes for the change to propagate due to DNS
        caching.</li>
        <li>DNS propagation/caching is particularly troublesome when doing multiple write operations on a key within a
        3-minute period. The first one takes effect, the second one doesn't because it's cached at the upstream
        nameservers & never reaches the <i>k-v.io</i> nameservers.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Technical Notes:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>There are three servers that back this service: two in the USA, one in Singapore, on three different
        platforms: AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud.</li>
        <li>The underlying key-value store is an etcd cluster. I chose etcd for no particular reason other than it's
        what Kubernetes uses.</li>
        <li>The <i>k-v.io</i> source code is in Golang, is hosted at <a href=
        "https://github.com/cunnie/sslip.io">GitHub</a>, and is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license.
        </li>
        <li>Much of the deployment information (terraform files, Kubernetes manifests) is also freely available at a
        <a href="https://github.com/cunnie/deployments/tree/main/terraform/gcp/gke">different GitHub repo</a>, and some
        of the workstation configuration is at a <a href=
        "https://github.com/cunnie/bin/blob/main/install_ns-aws.sh">third GitHub repo</a>. Yes, it's an organizational
        challenge.
        </li>
        <li>The DNS server code is a mash-up of key-value store and <a href="https://sslip.io">mapping hostnames with
        embedded IP addresses to those addresses</a> (e.g. <code>127.0.0.1.sslip.io</code> â†’ <code>127.0.0.1</code>).
        In a perfect world, I'd have separated the codebase into two and deployed <i>k-v.io</i> on a second set of
        three nameservers; however, I had neither the time nor the inclination to manage a 2nd set of DNS servers. So
        here we are.
        </li>
        <li>If you have suggestions (or notice that something's broken), please open a <a href=
        "https://github.com/cunnie/sslip.io/issues/new/choose">GitHub issue</a>.
        </li>
        <li>I was motivated to create this service because at my job we use S3 as a key-value store, and getting at the
        keys is a challenge because we need the AWS credentials, and to get at those credentials we need to use CredHub
        (a Vault-like secrets store). It's a lot of hoops to jump through to find out something as innocuous as the
        version number of the latest candidate build.</li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://dnskv.com/">dnskv.com</a> is a similar service with a rich set of options.
        </li>
