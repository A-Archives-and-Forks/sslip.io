*sslip.io* is a DNS server that maps specially-crafted DNS A records to IP
addresses (e.g. "127-0-0-1.sslip.io" maps to 127.0.0.1). It is similar to, and
inspired by, [xip.io](http://xip.io/).

If you'd like to use sslip.io _as a service_, refer to the website
([sslip.io](https://sslip.io)) for more information. This README targets
developers; the website targets users.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cunnie/sslip.io.git
cd sslip.io
go mod tidy
sudo go run main.go
 # sudo is required on Linux, but not on macOS, to bind to privileged port 53
```

In another window:
```bash
dig @localhost 192.168.0.1.sslip.io +short
 # should return "192.168.0.1"
```

### Quick Start Tests

```bash
go mod tidy
go generate
ginkgo -r -p .
```

## Running Your Own Nameservers

We can customize our nameserver and address records (NS, A, and AAAA), which
can be particularly useful in an internetless (air-gapped) environment. This can
be done with a combination of the `-nameservers` flag and the `-addresses` flag.

For example, let's say we're the DNS admin for pivotal.io, and we'd like to
have a subdomain, "xip.pivotal.io", that does sslip.io-style lookups (e.g.
"127.0.0.1.xip.pivotal.io" would resolve to "127.0.0.1"). Let's say we have two
servers that we've set aside for this purpose:

- ns-sslip-0.pivotal.io, 10.8.8.8 (IPv4)
- ns-sslip-1.pivotal.io, fc88:: (IPv6)

First, we delegate the subdomain "xip.pivotal.io" to our two nameservers, and
then we run the following command run on each of the two servers:

```bash
# after we've cloned our repo & cd'ed into it
go run main.go \
  -nameservers=ns-sslip-0.pivotal.io,ns-sslip-1.pivotal.io \
  -addresses ns-sslip-0.pivotal.io=10.8.8.8,ns-sslip-1.pivotal.io=fc88::
```

**Note: These nameservers are not general-purpose nameservers; for example,
they won't look up google.com. They are not recursive.** Don't ever configure a
machine to point to these nameservers.

### Running with Docker

Probably the easiest way to run the nameserver is with the official Docker
image,
[cunnie/sslip.io-dns-server](https://hub.docker.com/r/cunnie/sslip.io-dns-server):

```bash
docker run \
  -it \
  --rm \
  -p 53:53/udp \
  cunnie/sslip.io-dns-server
```

If we see the error, "`Error starting userland proxy: listen udp4 0.0.0.0:53:
bind: address already in use.`", we turn off the systemd resolver: `sudo
systemctl stop systemd-resolved`

Let's try a more complicated setup: we're on our workstation, jammy.nono.io,
whose IP addresses are 10.9.9.114 and 2601:646:0100:69f0:0:ff:fe00:72. We'd like
our workstation to be the DNS server:

```bash
docker run \
  -it \
  --rm \
  -p 53:53/udp \
  cunnie/sslip.io-dns-server \
    -nameservers jammy.nono.io \
    -addresses jammy.nono.io=10.9.9.114,jammy.nono.io=2601:646:100:69f0:0:ff:fe00:72
```

From another machine, we look up the DNS NS record for "127.0.0.1.com", and we
see the expected reply:

```bash
dig ns 127.0.0.1.com @jammy.nono.io +short
...
  ;; ANSWER SECTION:
  127.0.0.1.com.		604800	IN	NS	jammy.nono.io.

  ;; ADDITIONAL SECTION:
  jammy.nono.io.		604800	IN	A	10.9.9.114
  jammy.nono.io.		604800	IN	AAAA	2601:646:100:69f0:0:ff:fe00:72
```

The Docker image is multi-platform, supporting both x86_64 architecture as well
as ARM64 (AWS Graviton, Apple M1/M2).

## Command-line Flags

- `-port` overrides the default port, 53, which the server binds to. This can
  be especially useful when running as a non-privileged user, unable to bind to
  privileged ports (<1024) ("`listen udp :53: bind: permission denied`"). For
  example, to run the server on port 9553: `go run main.go -port 9553`. To query,
  `dig @localhost 127.0.0.1.sslip.io -p 9553`
- `-nameservers` overrides the default NS records `ns-aws.sslip.io`,
  `ns-azure.sslip.io`, `ns-gce.sslip.io`, and `ns-ovh.sslip.io`; flag, e.g. `go
run main.go -nameservers ns1.example.com,ns2.example.com`). If you're running
  your own nameservers, you probably want to set this. Don't forget to set
  address records for the new name servers with the `-addresses` flag (see
  below). Exception: `_acme-challenge` records are handled differently to
  accommodate the procurement of Let's Encrypt wildcard certificates; you can
  read more about that procedure [here](docs/wildcard.md)
- `-addresses` overrides the default A/AAAA (IPv4/IPv6) address records. For
  example, here's how we set the IPv4 record & IPv6 record for our nameserver (in
  the `-nameservers` example above), ns1.example.com: `-addresses
ns1.example.com=10.8.8.8,ns1.example.com=fc::8888`. Note that you can set many
  addresses for a single host, e.g.
  `ns1.example.com=1.1.1.1,ns1.example.com=8.8.8.8,ns1.example.com=9.9.9.9`
- `-blocklistURL` overrides the default block list,
  (<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cunnie/sslip.io/main/etc/blocklist.txt>).
  It's not necessary to override this if you're in an internetless environment:
  if the DNS server can't download the blocklist, it prints out a message and
  continues to serve DNS queries

## DNS Server Miscellany

- it binds to both UDP and TCP.
- The SOA record is hard-coded except the _MNAME_ (primary master name server)
  record, which is set to the queried hostname (e.g. `dig big.apple.com
  @ns-aws.nono.io` would return an SOA with an _MNAME_ record of
  `big.apple.com.`
- The MX records are hard-coded to the queried hostname with a preference of 0,
  except `sslip.io` itself, which has custom MX records to enable email
  delivery to ProtonMail
- There are no SRV records

## Directory Structure

- `ci/` contains the [Concourse](https://concourse.ci/) continuous integration
  (CI) pipeline and task
- `spec/` contains the tests for the production nameservers.  To run
  the tests locally:
  ```bash
  DOMAIN=sslip.io rspec --format documentation --color spec/
  ```
- `k8s/document_root_sslip.io/` contains the HTML content of the sslip.io
  website. Please run `tidy -im -w 120 k8s/document_root_sslip.io/index.html`
