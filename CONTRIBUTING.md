### Contributing to sslip.io

Thanks for your interest in sslip.io!  This project is primarily a personal
"for fun" project and I'm not looking to grow a community or accept
contributions at this time.

If you have an idea for an improvement:

- Forking is encouraged! Please feel free to fork the repository and make the
changes you'd like to see. You can then use your own forked version.
- If you're feeling particularly ambitious, deploy servers running your forked
code. A diverse ecosystem is better. Period.

I don't accept pull requests because **coding is the most fun** aspect of the
project, the last thing I'd want to outsource. Reviewing other people's
code? Not so fun. Dealing with abuse reports? Maintaining servers? Paying
hosting fees? Checking monitoring alerts? Not fun.

However, I might consider pull requests for the following:

- Critical security vulnerabilities: If you discover a serious security flaw,
please report it responsibly by opening an issue.
- Bugs: Include tests, use good commit messages, and squash your commits.
- Minor documentation fixes: Typos or small clarifications in the documentation
are welcome.

Thanks for understanding!
