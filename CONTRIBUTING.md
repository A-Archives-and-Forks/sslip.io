### Contributing to sslip.io

Thanks for your interest in sslip.io!  This project is primarily a personal
"for fun" project and I'm not actively looking to grow a community or accept
contributions at this time.

If you have an idea for an improvement:

- Forking is encouraged! Please feel free to fork the repository and make the
changes you'd like to see. You can then use your own forked version.
- If you're feeling particularly ambitious, deploy servers running your forked
code. A diverse ecosystem is better. Period.

I'm generally not accepting pull requests for the following reasons:

- Maintaining my vision: I have a specific vision for how sslip.io works and
evolves.
- Time commitment: Reviewing and merging pull requests takes time and focus
that I prefer to spend elsewhere.
- Keeping it simple: I want to keep the project manageable and avoid feature
creep.

However, I might consider pull requests for the following:

- Critical security vulnerabilities: If you discover a serious security flaw,
please report it responsibly by opening an issue.
- Bugs: Include tests, use good commit messages, and squash your commits.
- Minor documentation fixes: Typos or small clarifications in the documentation
are welcome.

Thanks for understanding!
